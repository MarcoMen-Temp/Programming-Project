## Programming For Data Analysis- A Jupyter Notebook Project

This repository contains, primarily a Jupyter Notebook with an investigation of stock prices fluctuations and its returns.
I used as a foundation for my simulated data, Nissan's historical stock prices.

To run this notebook in your machine I would advice cloning the repository. You must have [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) on your machine. You can install this using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) Python distribution.

Also, you must have install ['fix-yahoo-finance'](https://pypi.org/project/fix-yahoo-finance/) package, created by Ran Aroussi. This package is not available in the Anaconda distribution, so conda install is not available.
